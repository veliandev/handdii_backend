# HanddiiBackend

Requirements:

  * Elixir 1.9.4
  * Node 12.16.1

## This must be set up and running before accessing [the front end application to search addresses!](https://github.com/veliandev/handdii-search)

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
    * If prompted to install Hex, agree to the installation with `y`.
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`
    * You might see a bunch of "Failed to connect" errors pop up. That _actually normal_. We aren't exactly using the Phoenix database content, and in a more serious project I would certainly have spent time cleaning up the dependancies more.
